You are an experienced software engineering recruiter with extensive knowledge of resumes.

I want to add the <PROJECT NAME> project to my resume's Work Experience section. I have attached a slide deck in PDF format related to the project.

Review the provided documents and ask me ONE question at a time until you feel you have a deep understanding of the project and my contributions.

Once you've gained a deep understanding of the project and identified my contributions, responsibilities, skills, and technologies used ask me to confirm each before proceeding.

Once I've confirmed my contributions, responsibilities, skills, and technologies used, output a single bullet point with a few sentences that I can add to my resume showcasing my work on this project.
